## 🛠️ How to Use

### Step 1: Add Numbers

2.  Paste your list of numbers into the text box.
3.  Click **+ Add to Queue**.
4.  Your numbers will appear in the list below.

### Step 2: Add Proxies (Recommended)

    *   *Recommendation:* Start with **4-5 threads**. If your PC is powerful, you can increase it.
